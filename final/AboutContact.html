				<p>Hello! My name is Youngshim Gontijo, I am currently a senior illustration major at Massachusetts College of Art and Design. 
								My work tends to be described as sensitive, I work delicately with a decorative style. I have always been drawn to Aboriginal art, so much of my work reflects how I love the graphic, flat, line work.
								 I focus a lot on nature and the concept of light vs. dark. I have been working on fitting my style of illustration to meet the needs of potential branding quality. I want to get into logo design and branding in the future, combining elements of my illustrations with type.
